## Basic starter for firebase / redux / firestore / flow projects

Uses Firebase for auth, firestore for persistance, redux for state managment, flow for type checking and jest for testing, and Tachyons/Styled-Components for style

This is a basic starting place to quickly bootstrap projects. This is a work in progress and not intended as a reccomendation by any means.

Pull requests welcome.
